## OktaIdCWorkMailLambdaExample

Example script creates AWS Lambda which runs every 15 minutes and performs users synchronization between 
IdentityCenter and WorkMail. The synchronization works in one way, creating, enabling or disabling WorkMail users
based on their existence in IdentityCenter.

### General Workflow

1. Edit `app.py` file providing your accountId and region. 
2. Also enter needed details for your Lambda environment in `app.py` file.
3. Prepare your local environment for local testing: 

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install .
```

4. Prepare your stack - change `cdk.json` file providing full path to your python interpreter within created virtual environment
   (by default it refers to `.venv/bin/python3.12 app.py`)
5. Bootstrap package:

```bash
cdk bootstrap
```

6. Deploy your package (cdk will automatically synthesize your app as the first step before deploying)

```bash
cdk deploy
```
